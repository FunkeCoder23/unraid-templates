### Since Debrid Media Manager and all the underlying projects are in heavy development, I'll just document my changes to the xml, when necessary, in this file for those curious. Most of the time, I'd recommmend checking the actual project (Riven or whatever) for what actually changed and why it matters or doesn't to you.

#### Sept 22, 2024:

Many changes were pushed to the Riven front and backend.

Thank you to @spants (in the discord) for pointing out some variables to add to this xml: 
Front and backend update (true or false) and zurg update (true or false). 

If you wanna stay on the bleeding edge of all these projects, and we all know you do!, gotta have them tasty updates right when that little container turns orange!

Note: (small bug) Still working on figuring out how to make the Riven frontend version.txt show up correctly. Even with the file created and a path to it provided it won't update... perplexing...
The "Unknown" version is purely visual, however, so it can be ignored until that little issue is resolved in this template...
